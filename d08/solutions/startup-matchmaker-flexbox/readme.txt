Notes:
1) Set the image as a background CSS style (also look for background-position and backround-size)
2) To round the button's corners, look up the border-radius CSS property
3) To create the shadow for the buttons, look up box-shadow
4) Use the "rgba" color value to set the see-thru background of the "Meet your Match" element
